<p>Ur (/ʊər/; Sumerian: Urim;[1] Sumerian Cuneiform:romanized: Uru;[3] Arabic: أُوْر, romanized: ūr; Hebrew: וּר, romanized: ūr) was an 
     important Sumerian city-state in ancient Mesopotamia, located at the site of modern "Tell el-Muqayyar" 
     (Arabic: تل ٱلْمُقَيَّر) in south Iraq's Dhi Qar Governorate.[4] more words to put at the bottom so I can 
     reach the correct limit so that the empty space is full. still not quite there yet and it makes no sense to have this open
     space and then put more info it wouldnt hurt to add one more line.

 is a former defensive fortification of the Roman province of Britannia, begun in AD 122 in the reign of the emperor
  Hadrian.[1] Running the hadrian wall is one of the oldest walls and it shows the significance of structure building 
  in the ancient world of conquest and perpetual war, Walls like this could be used as choke points to direct
  army's where they can be taken all at once with less casualties and wasted resources.

<p>The fall of the Western Roman Empire (also called the fall of the Roman Empire or the fall of Rome) was the loss of 
    central political control in the Western Roman Empire, a process in which the Empire failed to enforce its rule, and
     its vast territory was divided into several successor polities. What truly caused the end of this empire well that 
     is for many reasons and you can never quite point to one because one thing is never really the answer but a collage of
     problems is more likely the cause of this collapse. Most of the military were the enemy (barbarians)

<p>The Great Wall of China (traditional Chinese: 萬里長城; simplified Chinese: 万里长城; pinyin: Wànlǐ Chángchéng) is a series 
    of fortifications that were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as 
    protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. China had a very sad and unfair struggle against the
    nothern nomads and they would bring so much destruction that it is no wonder that a border seemed the best
    defense because they didnt have the same war
